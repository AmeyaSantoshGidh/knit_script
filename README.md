## Packages

### knit_graphs
The knit_graphs package holds the components of a Knit_Graph representation of a knitted structure. Knit Graphs are 
collections of loops connected on yarns and pulled through each other to form a node-link graph structure. Networkx 
graphs are used to represent yarns and knit graphs. This provides a variety of common graph algorithms for 
manipulating and searching in a knit graph.
